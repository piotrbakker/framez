# Framez

Framez is a framework for naming various product design artefacts in Figma.

## Projects

Project names are either specific, related to a narrowly focused aspect of a product’s design (e.g., onboarding, activation, navigation, etc.) or general, suitable for covering a wide-range of design disciplines (e.g., information architecture, usability, interaction design, etc.). Project names follow [title case formatting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

## Files

File names are composed of the following elements:

```
[file category] [product name] [project name] [branch name]
```

Commonly used categories include:

* Wires — low-fidelity wireframes & sketches;
* Visual — high-fidelity mockups;
* Library — separate shared style & component repositories;
* System — multiple shared style & component repositories organized into a single file.

### Examples

```
Wires Acme Web Landing 2020-01
Visual Acme Web Account 2020-01
Library Acme Web Icons Main
System Acme Web Main
```
